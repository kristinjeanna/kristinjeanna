### About me

Hey! I'm Kristin. I work at a Chicago-area university as Java developer and an applications administrator. My work development is all Java but I dabble in Go for personal projects.

I started (work) life as a high school science teacher but have been in the IT field now for about 23 years in a variety of roles: user support, system administration, information security, and software development. The bulk of my IT experience is in the latter two.
